Movement
========
So far we've been drawing from the center of the canvas, but now it's
time to move.

By default the pen will draw on the canvas when it is moved, but you can
lift the pen from the canvas using `pen_up`.

You can lower it to draw again using `pen_down`.

Try moving your triangle to be somewhere else on the canvas.
