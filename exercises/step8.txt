Functions
=========
Hm, we still had to repeat ourselves if we wanted to draw two triangles,
and loops didn't help us much. It would be nice if we could just write
instructions for drawing a triangle, rather than having to explain how
to draw a triangle each time.

We can do this by writing a function! Functions are like recipes that
you reference from other recipes.

If we wanted to write a function to go forward by 10, then turn right by
90 degrees, we would do it as follows:

def go_forward_and_turn
  forward(10)
  turn_right(90)
end

We could then call this using `go_forward_and_turn`.

Try writing your own function to draw a triangle, then using it for both
of the triangles. Make sure you put the function definition inside the
do block!
