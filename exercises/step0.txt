Hi there!
=========
Today we'll be learning how to use Kame, a drawing library that lets you
control a virtual pen.

The get_started.rb file contains instructions that are just like a
recipe - we start by creating a new pen, and tell it that we want it to
something for us.

At the moment, our pen is drawing a line that is 50 pixels long.

Can you change the instructions to make it draw on twice as long? What
about half as long?
