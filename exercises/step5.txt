Loops
=====
In both the triangle and square examples, our code was kind of
repetitive: we'd go forward a bit, then turn, and repeat.

Rather than repeating ourselves, we can just say that we want to do
something a number of times. For example,
`2.times do
  forward(100)
  turn_right(20)
end`

Try converting your triangle code to use a loop instead.
