Basic shapes
============
We now know enough to start drawing shapes – have a shot at drawing a
square.

Now try changing the size of the square.

It would be nice if we could store the side length somehow so that we
only had to change one thing to change the size of the square, rather
than four.

We can do this using variables. These are like containers that allow you
to store one thing in them. We create a container by just setting a
word to a variable.

For example, to store the value 5 in a variable called forward_amount:
`forward_amount = 5`

Then later we could then use this variable to make our pen go forward
by 5:
`forward(forward_amount)`

Try changing your square to use a variable called side_length for its
side length. This will mean changing more than one piece of code now,
but in future you should just be able to change the value of the
variable.

Be careful – variable names can't have spaces in them and they're case
sensitive.
