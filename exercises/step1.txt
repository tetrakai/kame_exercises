Into another dimension
======================
Drawing different length lines is boring though, so let's learn to turn.

We can tell the pen to turn right by calling `turn_right(90)`. Just like
`forward(100)` you give it a number, but this time you're telling the
pen how many degrees you want it to turn.

Have a go at drawing a corner. You'll need to add a call to `turn_right`
and then to `forward`. Watch out, calls are case sensitive.

It can be confusing figuring out which way the pen is facing. If you get
a bit lost, you can call `show_tip` to draw the tip of the pen at that
point.

Try drawing a set of stairs!
